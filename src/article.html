      Hawaii’s beaches are owned by the public, and the government is required
      to preserve them. So years ago, officials adopted a “no tolerance” policy
      toward new seawalls, which scientists say are the primary cause of coastal
      erosion.

      But over the past two decades, oceanfront property owners across the state
      have used an array of loopholes in state and county laws to get around
      that policy, armoring their own properties at the expense of the
      environment and public shoreline access.

      Government officials have granted more than 230 environmental exemptions
      to owners of homes, hotels and condos, according to records compiled by
      the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and ProPublica. Those exemptions have allowed
      property owners to keep old seawalls in place, build new ones and install
      mounds of emergency sandbags along the beaches.

      Officials defend their actions, saying that forcing property owners to
      comply with anti-armoring laws would cause them too much hardship,
      particularly along coastlines that already have lots of seawalls.

      Over time, though, waves hitting the barriers pull the sand away from the
      shore and carry it out to sea. As a result, the government approvals have
      fueled beach loss and perpetuated the redevelopment of private properties
      along treasured and environmentally sensitive coastlines — all at a time
      when scientists have been warning of the dire need to push development
      inland.
