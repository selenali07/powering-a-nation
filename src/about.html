            <p>
              The loss of Hawaii’s beaches threatens the way of life in the
              islands and imperils the state’s tourist-driven economy. But the
              environmental damage of coastal armoring is already clear.
              Endangered species, like monk seals, have lost critical shoreline
              habitat. If Hawaii doesn’t step up enforcement of its “no
              tolerance” policy toward shoreline structures, scientists warn
              that, by midcentury, the state could be down to just a handful of
              healthy beaches.

            The data was compiled from public records requests filed with
            Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural Resources and the City and
            County of Honolulu’s Department of Planning and Permitting. The
            records include state approvals for seawall easements and emergency
            sandbags, as well as county approvals for new or illegally
            constructed seawalls. The documents cover approvals issued between
            2000 and 2020.

            What’s the connection between coal and electricity?

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Nearly 50 percent of U.S. electricity comes from coal. Coal-fired
              power plants burn coal to generate steam, which is used to turn
              the turbines of an electrical generator. The U.S. has one of the
              largest coal reserves in the world and burns it at about 600
              plants across the nation. Generating electricity from coal is
              common in the South and in the heartland, but less often used in
              regions such as the West Coast, where hydroelectricity and natural
              gas are bigger sources of power.

          <button class="acc-btn">
            If coal is so important to electricity generation, why are some
            people concerned about building new coal-fired power plants?
          </button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Coal plants emit carbon dioxide, a major ingredient in climate
              change. In recent years, NASA climate scientist James Hansen has
              advocated a moratorium on building new coal plants until
              technology is developed to prevent the carbon dioxide from
              escaping into the atmosphere. Hansen has warned that continuing to
              release carbon dioxide at current rates – even just for the next
              10 years – will create “a different planet – one without sea ice
              in the Arctic; with worldwide, repeated coastal tragedies
              associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level.” The
              proposed American Municipal Power plant in Meigs County would
              release an estimated 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide annually,
              according to CARMA, a nonprofit group.

          <button class="acc-btn">
            Why are there so many electricity-generating coal plants near Meigs
            County?

          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Coal has been a dominant industry for most of the region’s
              history. The county’s newest mine began producing coal last
              February.
