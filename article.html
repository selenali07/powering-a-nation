          <h1>Hawaii’s Beaches Are Disappearing</h1>
          <p class="article-summary">
            Hawaii is famous for its spectacular beaches. But over the past
            century, three of the state’s major islands, Oahu, Maui and Kauai,
            have lost roughly one-quarter of their sandy shores.

          <p>
            Hawaii’s beaches are owned by the public, and the government is
            required to preserve them. So years ago, officials adopted a “no
            tolerance” policy toward new seawalls, which scientists say are the
            primary cause of coastal erosion.
          </p>
          <p>
            But over the past two decades, oceanfront property owners across the
            state have used an array of loopholes in state and county laws to
            get around that policy, armoring their own properties at the expense
            of the environment and public shoreline access.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government officials have granted more than 230 environmental
            exemptions to owners of homes, hotels and condos, according to
            records compiled by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and ProPublica.
            Those exemptions have allowed property owners to keep old seawalls
            in place, build new ones and install mounds of emergency sandbags
            along the beaches.
          </p>
          <p></p>

              Oahu's Lanikai Beach has suffered some of the most rapid beach
              loss, almost entirely due to seawalls. This is what the beach
              looked like in 1968, following a surge of home development along
              its shore in the earlier half of the century.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Officials defend their actions, saying that forcing property owners
            to comply with anti-armoring laws would cause them too much
            hardship, particularly along coastlines that already have lots of
            seawalls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, though, waves hitting the barriers pull the sand away
            from the shore and carry it out to sea. As a result, the government
            approvals have fueled beach loss and perpetuated the redevelopment
            of private properties along treasured and environmentally sensitive
            coastlines — all at a time when scientists have been warning of the
            dire need to push development inland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1980s, homeowners increasingly built seawalls to protect
            their properties from the ocean, setting off a domino effect of
            erosion. That armoring has continued, despite the "no tolerance"
            policy set in 1999. Officials have continually allowed people to
            build new seawalls and reconstruct older, crumbling ones while
            approving illegally built structures after the fact.
          </p>

            />
            <figcaption>
              While seawalls have destroyed much of the public beach, the homes
              along this stretch of coastline continue to sell for millions of
              dollars as real estate agents boast of their private, oceanfront
              locations. Luxury homes listed for sale this year ranged in price
              from $4.9 million to $15.6 million.

            This wall of boulders at 1562 Mokulua Drive was built without
            approval. Despite the violation, officials with the City and County
            of Honolulu issued building permits in 2009 to the owner, allowing
            her to redevelop the property into a sprawling, luxury estate, which
            in 2015 sold for $9.35 million — more than double its 2006 sales
            price.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a seawall is significantly damaged or destroyed, state and county
            laws limit what property owners can do to repair it. But officials
            have been lenient in their approach to enforcement, ensuring
            shorelines like Lanikai remain fixed in place and armored for
            decades to come. This wall at 1368 Mokulua Drive was largely
            destroyed during a storm in 2003, but the owner was allowed to
            rebuild it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Owners have also found a loophole by getting approvals for temporary
            sandbags but then keeping the structures indefinitely. The sandbags
            at 1326 Mokulua Drive have been sitting on the beach since the
            1990s, after the previous owner was required to tear out an illegal
            seawall. This year, the City and County of Honolulu approved a new
            seawall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Old seawalls like this one at 1240 Mokulua Drive were built before
            Hawaii established coastal protection laws in the 1960s. In 2003,
            the property was purchased for $6 million and the new owner sought
            an easement to keep the wall in place for an additional 55 years.
            State officials gave their approval, which allowed the owner to
            redevelop the estate. Earlier this year, it was listed for sale for
            $21 million.

              width="600"
              height="400"

            />
            <figcaption>
              After the stretch of seawalled coastline, the beach reemerges.
              While this part of the shore has undergone a period of natural
              growth, scientists warn that erosion from the southern seawalls
              could eat away at this part of the beach too. Owners of the
              profiled properties declined or did not respond to requests for
              comment.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            On Oahu, where the majority of the state’s population lives, the
            ocean is threatening to damage or wash away hundreds of structures,
            including roads, hotels and homes. Owners looking to protect their
            properties have obtained seawall easements extending the life of
            walls, permits for emergency sandbags and county seawall approvals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one case, officials allowed owners of an estate tied to former
            President Barack Obama to exploit loopholes in Hawaii's
            environmental laws to revamp its aging seawall. The owners said they
            needed exemptions to protect the compound from the ocean and pursued
            them lawfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Particulate pollution and turbulence caused by waves slamming into
            seawalls has harmed already-stressed coral reefs and threatens to
            disrupt the islands’ famous surf breaks. The loss of Hawaii’s
            beaches threatens the way of life in the islands and imperils the
            state’s tourist-driven economy.
