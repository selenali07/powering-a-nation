            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
              The loss of Hawaii’s beaches threatens the way of life in the
              islands and imperils the state’s tourist-driven economy. But the
              environmental damage of coastal armoring is already clear.
              Endangered species, like monk seals, have lost critical shoreline
              habitat. If Hawaii doesn’t step up enforcement of its “no
              tolerance” policy toward shoreline structures, scientists warn
              that, by midcentury, the state could be down to just a handful of
              healthy beaches.

            The data was compiled from public records requests filed with
            Hawaii’s Department of Land and Natural sources and the City and
            County of Honolulu’s Department of Planning and Permitting. The
            records include state approvals for seawall easements and emergency
            sandbags, as well as county approvals for new or illegally
            constructed seawalls. The documents cover approvals issued between
            2000 and 2020.

            What is primary cause of coastal erosion?
          </button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Officials adopted a “no tolerance” policy toward new seawalls, of
              which scientists believe are the primary cause to coastal erosion.
            </p>
          </div>

          <button class="acc-btn">Why are seawalls harmful to beaches?</button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Seawalls eliminate the ability of beaches to naturally fluctuate
              with changing waves and tide. Sandy beaches are squished between
              an unyielding seawall and rising water levels.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="acc-btn">
            If they are so bad, why are the beaches flooded with makeshift
            seawalls?
          </button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Makeshift seawalls that property owners have built along the
              public beach to protect their homes from being sucked into the
              ocean. Such protections are supposed to be forbidden under state
              law, given the environmental damage that the makeshift structures
              can wreak on public beaches. When waves slam up against a hardened
              shoreline, they claw away at the sand, causing beaches to
              disappear.
            </p>
          </div>
          <button class="acc-btn">
            What measures are put into place to combat erosion?
          </button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              Hawaii lawmakers are considering bills this legislative session
              that could force oceanfront property owners to remove sandbags and
              draped heavy tarps that can significantly contribute to coastal
              erosion. Under state law, officials can fine property owners
              $15,000 a day for unauthorized structures that remain on the
              beach, though they have yet to take that step against homeowners
              with expired permits.

          <button class="acc-btn">
            How is the damage impacing local areas?
          </button>
          <div class="acc-content">
            <p>
              The negative impacts of seawall are easily seen. Oahu lanikai
              beach has suffered some of the most rapid beach loss, almost
              entirely due to seawalls. Oahu has already lost about one-quarter
              of its beaches to shoreline hardening over the last century, and
              scientists warn that figure could rise to 40% by 2050.
